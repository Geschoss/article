## 2.3 The Nature of Enviroments
**task enviroments** which are essentially the "problem" to wich rational agents are the "solution".

### 2.3.1 Specifying the task enviroment
**PEAS**
Performance
Environment
Actuators
Sensors
**Software agent**
**softbot**

### 2.2.2 Properties of task environments
**fully observable**
**partially observable**

**competitive**
**cooperative**

**stochastic** - explicity deals with probabilities.
**nondeterministic** - the possibilities are listed without being quantified

**episodic vs. sequential**
episodic - the agent's experience is divided into atomic episodes, the next episode does not depend on the actions taken in previous episodes.
sequential - the current decision could affect all future decisions.

**static vs. dynamic**
dynamic environment can change while an agent is deliberating.
static environment can't change.

**discrete vs. continuous**
The discrete/continuous distinction applies to the _state_ of environment, to the way _time_ is handled, and to the _percept_ and _actions_ of the agent.

**known vs. unknown**

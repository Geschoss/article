## 2.2 Good Behavior: The Concept of Rationality

A **rational agent** is one that does the right thing.

### 2.2.1 Performance measures
**consequentialism**
**performance measure**

_As a general rule, it is better to design performance measures according to what one actually wants to be achieved in the environment, rather that according to how one thinks the agent should behave._

### 2.2.2 Rationality
Rational at any given time depends n four things:
- The performance measure that defines the criterion of seccess.
- The agent's prior knowledge of the environment.
- The actions that thr agent can perform.
- The agent's percept sequence to date.

**Definition of a rational agent:**
_For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever build-in knowledge the agent has._


### 2.2.3 Omniscience, learning, and autonomy
Rationality maximizes _expected_ performance,
while perfection maximizes _actual_ performance.

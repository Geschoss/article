rationality - loosely speaking, doing the "right thing".


#### Turing test

- **natural language processing**
    communicate successfully in human language
- **knowledge representation**
    store what it knows or hears
- **automated reasoning**
    answer questions and to draw new conclusions
- **machine learning**
    adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns

To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need:
- **computer vision** and speech recognition to perceive the world
- **robotics** to manipulate objects and move about

**We can learn about human thought in three ways:**
- **introspection** - trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
- **psychological experiments** - obserbing a person in action
- **brain imaging** - observing the brain in action

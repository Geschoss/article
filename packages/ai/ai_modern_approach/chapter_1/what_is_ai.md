### What is AI?

rationality - loosely speaking, doing the "right thing".


#### Turing test

- **natural language processing**
    communicate successfully in human language
- **knowledge representation**
    store what it knows or hears
- **automated reasoning**
    answer questions and to draw new conclusions
- **machine learning**
    adapt to new circumstances and to detect and extrapolate patterns

To pass the total Turing test, a robot will need:
- **computer vision** and speech recognition to perceive the world
- **robotics** to manipulate objects and move about

**We can learn about human thought in three ways:**
- **introspection** - trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by
- **psychological experiments** - obserbing a person in action
- **brain imaging** - observing the brain in action


#### 1.2.3 Economics

- How should we make decisions in accordance with our preferences?
- How should we do this when othen others may not go along?
- How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?


**Adam Smith** 1723-1790
_An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations_ (1776)
_The Theory of Moral Sentiments_ (1759)
_The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior_ (1944)
Economics is no longer the study of money; rather it is the study of desires and preferences.

_Markov decision processes_
_reinforcement learning_

**Herbert Simon** 1916-2001

#### 1.2.4 Neuroscience
- How do brains process information?

**Paul Broca's** 1824-1880
identifying a localized area in the left hemisphere that is responsible for speech production.
**Camillo Golgi** 1843-1926
develop a staining technique allowing the observation of individual neurons.
_a collectioins of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness_

#### 1.2.5 Психология

- Как думают и действуют люди и животные?

**Wilhelm Wundt** 1832-1920

**Frederic Bartlett** 1886-1969
_The Nature of Explanation_

_Three key steps of knowledge-based agent:
- the stimulus must be translatd into an internal representation
- the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive new internal representations
- these are in turn retranslated back into action

**Donalf Broadbent**
_Perception and Communicatioin_ (1958) - one of the first works to model psychological phenomena as information processing.
**cognitive science**

**George Miller**

#### 1.2.6 Computer engineering
- How can we build an effcient computer?

_Z-3_ - first operationsl programmable computer, the invention of Konrad Zuse

_Plankalkul_ - first high-level programming language
_Moore's law_ - increase in speed and capacity and a decrease in price
_Quantum computing_

#### 1.2.7 Control theory and cybernetics
- How can artifacts operate under their own control?

*Cornelis Drebbel* 1572-1633
thermostat and the submarine

*Norbert Wiener* 1894-1964
_control theory_
_Cybernetics_ (1948) - book, became a bestseller and awoke the public to the possibility of artificially intellignet machines.

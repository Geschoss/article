### 1.3 The history of Artificial Intelligence

_Turing award_
- 1969-1971 **Marvin Minsky** & **John McCarthy** for defining the foundations of the field base on representation and reasoning

- 1994 **Ed Feigenbaum** & **Raj Reddy** for developing expert systems that encode human knowledge to solve real-world problems

- 2011 **Judea Pearl** for developing probabilistic reasoning techniques that deal with uncertainty in a principled manner

- 2019 **Yoshua Bengio** & **geoffrey Hinton** & **Yann LeCun** for making _deep learning_

#### 1.3.1 The inception of artifiial intelligence

**Warren McCullosh** & **Walter Pitts** 1943
Drew on three sources:
- knowledge of the basic physiology and function of neurons in the brain
- a formal analysis of proposional logic due to Russell ans Whitehead
- Turing's theory of computatuion

_factually equivalent to a proposition which proposed its adequate stimulus_

**Donald Hebb** (1949) - demonstrated a simple updating rule for modifying the connection strengths between neurons.
_hebbian learning_

**Marvin Minsky** (1927-2016)
**Dean Edmonds**
build the first neural network computer in 1950
_if it isn't now, it will be someday_


#### 1.3.2 Early enthusiasm, great expectations
**Newell and Simon**
1976 _physical symbol system_ - physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action

**Herbert Gelernter** 1959
_Geometry Theorem Prover_ 

**Jonh McCarthy**
1958  _Lisp_
_Programs with Common Sense_

**Marvin Minsky**
_microworlds_


#### 1.3.3 A dose of reality

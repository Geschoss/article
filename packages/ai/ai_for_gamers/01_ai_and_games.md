## AI and Gamse

### 1 Introduction

Разработка компьютерных игр - это отдельная область.
Свои скилы, идиомы и задачи. А так же очень много фана.
Каждая студия делает свою реализацию одного алгоритма.

#### 1.1 What is AI?
AI is about making computers able to perform the thinking tasks that humans and animals are capable of.
As games developers, we are primarily interested in only the engineering side: building algorithms that make game characters appear human or animal-like.

#### 1.1.1 Academic AI
academic ai periods:
- the early days
- the symbolic era
- the modern era

**The Early Days**
time before computers
occasionally forays philosophy of mind with questions as:
_What produces thought?_
_Could you give life to an inanimate object?_
_What is the difference between a cadaver and the human it previosly was?_
break enemy codes
to perform the calculations required for atomic warfare

**The Symbolic Era**
_symbolic_ systems:
1. _set of knowledge_ - represented as symbols such as words, numbers, sentences or pictures
1. _a reasoning algorithm_ - that manipulates those symbols to create new combinations of symbols that hopefully resresent problem solutions or new knowledge

_expert system_ -one of the purest expressions of this approach
blackboard architectures, pathfinding, decision trees, state machines and steering algorithms

A common feature of symbolci systems is a trade-off: when solving a problem the more knowledge you have, the less work you need to do in reasoning.

**The Modern Era**
frustration about that successes on simple problem din't seem to scale to more difficult ptoblems.
neural networks, genetic algorithms simulated annealing.
techniques could be explained mathematically
